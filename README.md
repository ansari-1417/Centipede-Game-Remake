# Centipede Game
## Overview
This project is a recreation of the classic Atari Centipede game, developed as part of our Programming Fundamentals coursework using C++. Over the course of one month, I implemented all the core features of the original game while enhancing it with additional textures and sprites to provide a modern aesthetic. Leveraging the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML), I incorporated graphical elements to bring the game to life. Additionally, I introduced an optional Space Shooter theme and added gameplay features such as increasing the centipede's speed and length, creating a progressively challenging environment for players.

## How to Run
- Create a project file in Visual Studio.
- Copy all the files into the project file.
- Make sure that you have linked SFML to the Visual Studio project.

## Features
- This game includes all the basic features from the original centipede game.
- Centipede's speed as well as number of total mushrooms increasing with each advancing level.
- The game menu includes functionalities such as newgame, resume, instructions, controls, highscores, settings, themes and exit game.

### Additional Features
- Additional sprites are added to add an aesthetic modern look.
- Space Themed sprites are available, giving space shooter vibes.
